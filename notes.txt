Pickl
    - Note selection not showing on phone...but other cats work fine

Lucille:
    - alt chord types not rendering

Tabulous:
    #s inversion switch failing because it's translating to b
    F Major looks like crap
    alt tunings don't work
    ostrich and dobro tuning freaks out
    d chords not right...might need condition for open chords, or just crawl every fret and remove unfingerables
    keep crawling for alternate frettings on open strings up to breadth of 5
